# Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for the great puzzles and a great time I had solving them.

For the year 2018 I decided to go with Scala [ZIO](https://zio.dev). Why not try a language that feels more strange to me? My goal this time is only to finish, and maybe learn something on my way.

If you look at the code and see ways I could improve it, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always grateful for everything that makes me a better programmer.

Also, if you ever look for a programmer and think my code is any good, please also contact me at once.
